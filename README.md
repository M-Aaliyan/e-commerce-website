This is an E commerce website I built using a boilerplate and created with the MERN stack

currently, its a marketplace for buying and selling ship services such as cruise rides and motor boat rentals

previously, I had planned to make it a shop for furniture and household items but decided to change and completely redesign it.

this project was to learn and develop skills with React and the MERN stack as well as understand what it takes to redesign a website

requires fix
